# # Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Machine Learning and Python



This is a program that uses the dual moving average crossover to determine when to buy and sell stocks

## What is Algorithmic Trading Strategy ?

- Developing an Algorithmic trading strategy with Python is something that goes through a couple of phases, just like when you build machine learning models: you formulate a strategy and specify it in a form that you can test on your computer, you do some preliminary testing or back testing, you optimize your strategy and lastly, you evaluate the performance and robustness of your strategy.
- Trading strategies are usually verified by back testing: you reconstruct, with historical data, trades that would have occurred in the past using the rules that are defined with the strategy that you have developed.

This way, you can get an idea of the effectiveness of your strategy, and you can use it as a starting point to optimize and improve your strategy before applying it to real markets.

This relies heavily on the underlying theory or belief that any strategy that has worked out well in the past will likely also work out well in the future.

And any strategy that has performed poorly in the past will probably also do badly in the future.
